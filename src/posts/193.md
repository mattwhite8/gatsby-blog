# 19.3

So far, each workout in the CrossFit games has come across as specifically designed to humble me, and 19.3 does not buck that trend in the slightest. In fact, half the movments I had to scale down entirely.


## The Workout

For time:
200-ft. dumbbell overhead lunge
50 dumbbell box step-ups
50 strict handstand push-ups
200-ft. handstand walk

50-lb. dumbbell, 24-in. box 
Time cap: 10 minutes


## My Score

76 reps / scaled


## My Takeaway

Ultimately, I'm not doing this to compete (at least not this year). I'm just here for the pride of accomplishing something that is truly challenging. Even though I scaled the handstand push-ups to box push-ups and the handstand walk to a bear crawl, I still feel that I walked away from this knowing I gave it my all. 

If I keep up at the pace I'm currently going, I'm going to kill it next year!
