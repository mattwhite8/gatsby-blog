title: "Surviving squat cleans"

# 19.2

Sometimes a workout comes along that is solely intended to put you in your place. 19.2 was that workout. 

More specifically, squat cleans are **hard**.


## The Workout

-----

Beginning on an 8-minute clock, complete as many reps as possible of:
- 25 toes-to-bars
- 50 double-unders
- 15 squat cleans, 135 lb.
- 25 toes-to-bars
- 50 double-unders
- 13 squat cleans, 185 lb.

If completed before 8 minutes, add 4 minutes to the clock and proceed to:
- 25 toes-to-bars
- 50 double-unders
- 11 squat cleans, 225 lb.

If completed before 12 minutes, add 4 minutes to the clock and proceed to:
- 25 toes-to-bars
- 50 double-unders
- 9 squat cleans, 275 lb.
If completed before 16 minutes, add 4 minutes to the clock and proceed to:

- 25 toes-to-bars
- 50 double-unders
- 7 squat cleans, 315 lb.

Stop at 20 minutes.


## My Score

-----

A sweating, out of breath mess.

But seriously, I got 3 reps into the set of 13 squat cleans and totally lost momentum.


## My Takeaway

-----

Theres no way of getting around this: squat cleans are, to me, one of the harder olympic style lifts. I stuck with 95lbs throughout and had to take a moment to rest each rep. One thing I believe that will improve my future performance will be to work on my pause squats. Every time we hit those in CrossFit I walk away feeling ever so stronger on my squat.
