# 19.1

Wall-balls, my arch nemesis.

I swear, nothing in the Crossfit repertoire taxes me like sustained wall-balls. Every time we incorporate them into our WOD, I just collapse onto the floor by the end — a sweaty mess. So, of course they would make their way into the inaugural Crossfit Open WOD.


## The Workout

Complete as many rounds as possible in 15 minutes of:
19 wall-ball shots
19-cal. row

*Men throw* *14-lb. ball to 10-ft. target*


## My Score

214 reps / scaled


## My Takeaway

I always wonder why wall-balls are so draining on me.  Ultimately I believe there is a deficiency in the way that I catch the ball. Usually as the ball falls, I catch it and absorb the momentum in my forearms and biceps. Only after the ball is resting on my chest do I squat down and repeat the motion. 

A much better way to conserve energy would be to already be squatting down as the ball descends — that way I could transfer the downward motion of the ball into my squat, saving my arms from some of the abuse.
